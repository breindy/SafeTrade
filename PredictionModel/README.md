### Description

This is a group project for Fall 2018 Intro to Data Science course at The City College of New York with Professor Grant Long.

SafeTrade will be a smart investment platform for safe stock trading. SafeTrade will allow buying of only those stocks that are above a threshold value/rating. Depending on the threshold value, every stock will be given a rating. Rating will also determine the next appropriate action for this stock buy/sell.
